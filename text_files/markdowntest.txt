# Sample Markdown

This is a simple Markdown document to test the Markdown to HTML conversion capabilities of your Go program.

## Headings

The document includes examples of different levels of headings.

### Subheading Level 3

More detailed topics can have their own headings.

#### Subheading Level 4

Even more detail under a subheading.

## Paragraphs

Paragraphs are separated by empty lines. Within a paragraph, you can have text that is **bold**, _italic_, or even `inline code`.

## Lists

You can also include lists in your Markdown.

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 2.1
  - Subitem 2.2
- Item 3

Numbered lists work too:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
